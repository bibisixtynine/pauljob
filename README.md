This is a french version for 'Ask your scenario !'

## How to edit with VSCODE ?
# clone the the "gpt3-writer-starter" project from buildspace repo in your github account
[the gpt3-writer-starter repo](https://github.com/buildspace/gpt3-writer-starter.git)
=> now your have your own copy on github !
# download this clone on your computer with VSCode and the adress of your clone
=> your cloned project url should look like:
https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE/gpt3-writer-starter.git
# install next, react, and react-dom and then run yarn to get the project going :
cd into the repo
=> cd gpt3-writer-starter
install next if you don't have it
=> yarn add next react react-dom
run it
=> yarn dev
# Head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should see the webapp !
